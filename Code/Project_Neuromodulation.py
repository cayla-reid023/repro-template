# ---
# # Code Development
# The follwing section is for code development. This should include details about the code and it's components. 
# 
# Note: Good idea to have different cell for different parts/functions of the code. 

# In[14]:


# Load Libraries 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# In[15]:


# Set variables 


# In[16]:


# Create function


# In[17]:


# Call function

# # Troubleshooting 
# This section should include any helpful information, code, how to's, and lessons learned. This can include links, directory paths, and solution explanations. Ideally, if someone (or you at a later date) needs to pick up where you left off what would they need to know in order to run your code and what would help future troubleshooting. 

# Examples:
# - If your IP address gets blocked by the NIH website then get permission from NIH.
# - To quickly access a libray save it as an abbreviated name `import numpy as np`
